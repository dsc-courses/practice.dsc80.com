Welcome to the Final Exam for DSC 80. This is an open-book, open-note exam, but you are not permitted to discuss the exam with anyone until after grades are released.

This exam has several coding questions. These questions will be manually graded, and your answers are *not* expected to be syntactically-perfect! Be careful not to spend too much time perfecting your code.
