Currently, `students` has a lot of repeated information --- for
instance, if a student applied to 10 universities, their GPA appears 10
times in `students`.

We want to generate a DataFrame that contains a single row for each
student, indexed by `"Email"`, that contains their `"Name"`,
`"High School"`, `"GPA"`, and `"APs"`.

One attempt to create such a DataFrame is below.

    students.groupby("Email").aggregate({"Name": "max",
                                         "High School": "mean",
                                         "GPA": "mean",
                                         "APs": "max"})

There is exactly one issue with the line of code above. **In one
sentence**, explain what needs to be changed about the line of code
above so that the desired DataFrame is created.

0.75in Change the key for `"High School"` to something that works for
strings, like `"max"`.
