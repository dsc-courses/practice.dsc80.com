Welcome to the Midterm Exam for DSC 80 in Spring 2022!

Throughout this exam, we will be using to the following dataframe `students`, which contains various information about high school students and the university/universities they applied to.

The columns are:

 - `'Name' (str)`: the name of the student.
 - `'High School' (str)`: the High School that the student attended.
 - `'Email' (str)`: the email of the student.
 - `'GPA' (float)`: the GPA of the student.
 - `'AP' (int)`: the number of AP exams that the student took.
 - `'University' (str)`: the name of the university that the student applied to.
 - `'Admit' (str)`: the acceptance status of the student (where 'Y' denotes that they were accepted to the university and 'N' denotes that they were not).

 The rows of `'student'` are arranged in no particular order. The first eight rows of `'student'` are shown below (though `'student'` has many more rows than pictured here).
