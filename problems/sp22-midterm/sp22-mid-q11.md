# BEGIN PROB

Consider the following pair of hypotheses.

-   **Null hypothesis:** The distribution of admitted, waitlisted, and
    rejected students at UC San Diego from Warren High is equal to the
    distribution of admitted, waitlisted, and rejected students at UC
    San Diego from La Jolla Private.

-   **Alternative hypothesis:** The distribution of admitted,
    waitlisted, and rejected students at UC San Diego from Warren High
    is different from the distribution of admitted, waitlisted, and
    rejected students at UC San Diego from La Jolla Private.

# BEGIN SUBPROB

What type of test is this?

( ) Hypothesis test
( ) Permutation test

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer: ** Permutation test

There are two relevant distributions at play here:

-   The distribution of admit/waitlist/reject proportions at Warren
    High.

-   The distribution of admit/waitlist/reject proportions at La Jolla
    Private.

To generate new data under the null, we need to **shuffle** the group
labels, i.e. randomly assign students to groups.

<average>89</average>

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Which of the following test statistics would be appropriate to use in
this test? **Select all valid options.**

[ ] Warren High admit rate
[ ] Difference between Warren High and La Jolla Private admit rates
[ ] Absolute difference between Warren High and La Jolla Private admit rates
[ ] Total variation distance (TVD)
[ ] Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer: ** Option 4

The two distributions described in 11(a) are categorical, and the TVD is
the only test statistic that measures the \"distance\" between two
categorical distributions.

<average>79</average>
