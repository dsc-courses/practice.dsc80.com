What kind of variable is `"APs"`?

( ) Quantitative discrete
( ) Quantitative continuous
( ) Qualitative ordinal
( ) Qualitative nominal

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer: ** Quantitative discrete
Since we can count the number of `"APs"` a student is enrolled in, it is clearly a quantitative variable. Also note that the number of `"APs"` a student is enrolled in has to be a whole number,hHence, it is a quantitative discrete variable.

Because we can sort universities by admit rate, `"University"` is a
qualitative ordinal variable.

( ) True
( ) False

**Answer: ** False

In order for a categorical variable to be ordinal, there must be some
inherent order to the categories. We can always sort a categorical
column based on some other column, but that doesn't make the categories
themselves ordinal. For instance, we can sort colors based on how much
King Triton likes them, but that doesn't make colors ordinal!
