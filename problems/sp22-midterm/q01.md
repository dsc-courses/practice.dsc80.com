What kind of variable is `"APs"`?

( ) Quantitative discrete
( ) Quantitative continuous
( ) Qualitative ordinal
( ) Qualitative nominal

# BEGIN SOLN

We can count the number of `"APs"` a student is enrolled in --- it
cannot be a fractional number. Hence, it is a quantitative discrete
variable.

# END SOLN

# END SUBPROB

# BEGIN SUBPROB

Because we can sort universities by admit rate, `"University"` is a
qualitative ordinal variable.

( ) True
( ) False

# BEGIN SOLN

In order for a categorical variable to be ordinal, there must be some
inherent order to the categories. We can always sort a categorical
column based on some other column, but that doesn't make the categories
themselves ordinal. For instance, we can sort colors based on how much
King Triton likes them, but that doesn't make colors ordinal!
