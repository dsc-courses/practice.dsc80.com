Let's recall Project 1, where the concept of redemption score was
introduced. According to this idea, the course could reward students for
showing an improvement in their understanding of the earlier ideas in
the course on the final exam.

Suppose the final exam was worth 80 points. A total point of 40 were
associated with questions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9, which were the redemption
questions. The class's mean score on just the redemption questions was
0.8, with a standard deviation of 0.2.

Suppose the midterm exam was worth 70 points. The class's mean score on
the midterm exam was 0.6, with a standard deviation of 0.5.

Tiffany, a student in the course, earned a $\frac{60}{80}$ on the final
exam, including a $\frac{30}{40}$ on the redemption questions, and a
$\frac{50}{70}$ on the midterm exam.\
Should her final exam score be replaced using the rule in Project 1?

( ) Yes

( ) No\
Which metric did you use in Project 1 to conclude that?

Suppose Tony Stark has implemented a decision tree classifier from
scratch and trained it using different criteria and maximum depths in a
10-fold cross-validation. Based on the results table below, which row
(numbered 1 to 8) should he choose as his final model?
