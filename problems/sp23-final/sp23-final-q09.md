Let's recall Project 1, where the concept of redemption score was introduced. According to this idea, the course could reward for showing improvement in their understanding of the earlier ideas in the course on the final exam.
Suppose the final exam was worth 80 points. A total of 40 points were associated with questions 2, 4, 6, 8, and 9, which were the redemption questions. The class's mean score on just the redemption questions was 0.8, with a standard deviation of 0.2.
Suppose the midterm exam was worth 70 points. The class's mean score on the midterm exam was 0.6, with a standard deviation of 0.5.
Tiffany, a student in the course, earned a $\frac{60}{80}$ on the final exam, including a $\frac{30}{40}$ on the redemption questions, and a $\frac{50}{70}$ on the midterm exam.
