A pharmaceutical company conducted a clinical trial to compare the efficacy of two drugs, Drug A and Drug B, in treating a specific medical condition. The trial involved two groups of patients, Group X and Group Y. The results of the trial are as follows:

Group X:

- Drug A: 80% success rate (120 patients out of 150)
- Drug B: 75% success rate (225 patients out of 300)

Group Y:

- Drug A: 70% success rate (70 patients out of 100)
- Drug B: 60% success rate (120 patients out of 200)

Based on these results, which drug would you conclude is more effective overall?

( ) Drug A
( ) Drug B
( ) It is impossible to determine from the given data
( ) The results are contradictory, and no conclusion can be made

# BEGIN SOLN
**Answer:** Drug A

The overall success rate of drug A is $\frac{120+70}{150+100}$ = $\frac{190}{250}$ \
The overall success rate of drug B is $\frac{75+60}{300+200}$ = $\frac{345}{500}$

$\frac{190}{250} > \frac{345}{500}$ so Drug A is likely more effective overall.

**Answer:** A trick question! Although the results may seem like an example of Simpson's Paradox, it is not, because the trend within each group is consistent (A is always better) and A is more effective overall. Since we're asked to determine which drug is more effective **overall**, we should calculate the success rate of Drug A and Drug B across both groups. The comparison is $$\frac{190}{250} > \frac{345}{500}$$, so Drug A is more effective overall.
