Sam Altman has trained a Logistic Regression model to classify emails
into "Spam" / "Non-Spam" categories/classes. Here, 'Spam' is the
positive class. Once the model is trained, Sam opted to evaluate the
model performance on the testing set. The Logistic Regression outputs a
value between 0 and 1. When the output of the Logistic Regression model
is greater than or equal to the threshold, the email is classified as a
'Spam' email. By varying the threshold, Sam creates the following
Precision-Recall graph.

Suppose you want to predict if people are depressed based on their
Electrocardiogram ECG signal. To train your model, you sampled ECG data
from 100 people, with 80% of them not being depressed. Which of the
following metrics is definitely not suitable for evaluating this binary
classification model? Select all that apply.

( ) Precision ( ) Recall ( ) Accuracy ( ) F1 Score\
For the purposes of such a binary depression classification task, which
is more important?

( ) high precision ( ) high recall\
For the purposes of determining whether someone committed a crime, which
is more important?

( ) high precision ( ) high recall\
In the context of a spam detector, an important email from a legitimate
source ending up in one's spam folder is an example of what?

( ) True Positive ( ) False Positive ( ) False Negative ( ) True
Negative
