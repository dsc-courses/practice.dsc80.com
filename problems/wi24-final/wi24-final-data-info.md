The DSC 80 staff are looking into hotels â€” some in San Diego, for their family to stay at for graduation, and some elsewhere, for summer trips.

**In Question 1 only**, you will work with the DataFrame `hotels`. Each row of `hotels` contains information about a different hotel in San Diego. Specifically, for each hotel, we have:

- `"Hotel Name" (str)`: The name of the hotel. **Assume hotel names are unique.**
- `"Location" (str):` The hotel's neighborhood in San Diego
- `"Chain" (str):` The chain the hotel is a part of; either `"Hilton", "Marriott", "Hyatt", or "Other".` A hotel chain is a group of hotels owned or operated by a shared company
- `"Number of Rooms" (int)`: The number of rooms the hotel has.

The first few rows of `hotels` are shown below, but hotels has many more rows than are shown.

Remember that `hotels` is only being used in Question 1; other questions will introduce other assumptions.

**Throughout the exam**, assume we have already run the necessary import statements.
