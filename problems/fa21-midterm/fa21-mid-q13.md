Suppose some of the entries in the `"Body Mass (g)"` column are missing.

Body mass measurements were taken any time a penguin walked across a scale that was placed outside. In your experience, the scale sometimes fails to make a measurement if the item placed on top is too small.

What is the most likely type of missingness in this case?

( ) Missing Completely at Random
( ) Missing at Random
( ) Not Missing at Random
( ) Missing by Design

Below, you may optionally provide justification for your answer. If your answer above is correct, you will get full credit even if you do not provide justification. However, if your answer above is wrong, you may receive some credit if you provide justification and it is reasonable.

**Answer: ** Option C

The answer is NMAR since the missigness of the values depend on the value itself, namely, the value would most likely be missing for smaller body mass penguins because the scale wouldn't be able to make a measurment "if the item placed on top is too small".

<average>88</average>
