Suppose you now look at the distribution of culmen depth for each species once more and again find the following:

What test statistic is the best choice for testing whether the empirical distributions of culmen depth in Chinstrap and Adelie penguins came from different underlying distributions?

( ) the Kolmogorov-Smirnov Statistic
( ) the absolute difference in means
( ) the TVD
( ) the signed difference in means

**Answer: ** Option A

Since the distribution of culmen depth are more or less the same and they are stacked on top of each other (meaning that the location of the distributions are pretty close to each other), it would make the most sense to use KS statistic. We wouldn't be able to used the difference in means because, again, the means of the distribution look to be able the same and we want to see if there is a different distribution of culmen depth. Furthermore, TVD wouldn't work well since culmen depth is a continuous quantitative varaible.
