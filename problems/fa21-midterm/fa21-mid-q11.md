Suppose you look at the distribution of culmen (beak) depth for each species and find the following:

It looks as though Chinstrap penguins have larger culmen depth than Gentoo penguins. Which of the following test statistics could be used to test this alternative hypothesis against the null hypothesis that the two distributions are the same? Check all that apply.

[ ] TVD
[ ] Kolmogorov-Smirnov
[ ] signed difference in mean culmen depth
[ ] unsigned difference in mean culmen depth

# BEGIN SOLN
**Answer: ** Option C

Note that from the image, we notice that the shape of the distribution of culmen depth for Chinstrap and Gentoo are pretty similar. The main difference is the location (ie the Gentoo distribution seems to be shifted to the left). Thus an appropriate test statistic would be the signed difference in mean culmen depth. We used the signed difference because we want to test whether Chinstrap penguins have LARGER culmen depth, not whether or not they have different culment depths.

<average>38</average>
