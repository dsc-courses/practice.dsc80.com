# BEGIN PROB

Suppose we wish to fill in the missing value in the pivot table above. What makes the most sense to fill it in with?

( ) 0
( ) 1
( ) `np.inf` (infinity)
( ) the mean of the "small" column
( ) the mean of the "Gentoo" row
( ) a number chosen at random from the observed values in the "small" column
( ) a number at random from the uniform distribution on [0, 1]

# BEGIN SOLN
**Answer: ** 0

As explained in the solution of Q7. Since there were no Gentoo Small penguins, it makes sense to fill in the missing value of the pivot table with 0.

<average>93</average>
