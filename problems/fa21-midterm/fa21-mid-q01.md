What kind of data is in the column named "Species"?

( ) quantitative
( ) nominal
( ) ordinal

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer: ** nominal

From the dataset, it is clear that the "species" attribute of each row is qualitative, and since there is no inherent order in the "species" of each penguin, we conclude that the "species" column is nominal.

<average>97</average>
