Suppose some of the entries in the `"Delta 15 N (o/oo)"` and `"Delta 13 C (o/oo)"` columns are missing.

The measurements above were taken by four different teams located at different places in Antarctica, and one of the teams had a faulty measurement device that prevented them from measuring "Delta 15 N" and "Delta 13 N". The penguins in this team's area were mostly Gentoo penguins.

What is the most likely type of missingness in this case?

( ) Missing Completely at Random
( ) Missing at Random
( ) Not Missing at Random
( ) Missing by Design

Below, you may optionally provide justification for your answer. If your answer above is correct, you will get full credit even if you do not provide justification. However, if your answer above is wrong, you may receive some credit if you provide justification and it is reasonable.

# BEGIN SOLN
**Answer: ** Option B

The answer is MAR because knowing the species of the penguin species gives you information on whether the measurements are missing or not, namely, Gentoo penguins are more likely to have missing measurments.
