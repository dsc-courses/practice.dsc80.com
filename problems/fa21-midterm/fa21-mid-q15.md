Suppose some of the entries in the `"Flipper Length (mm)"` column are missing.

It is very hard to measure the flipper length of a wild penguin because penguins have a tendency to run away whenever you approach them with a ruler. For this reason, the researchers agree that they will only measure the flipper length of half of the penguins they see. To implement this, they flip a coin when they see a penguin -- if the coin comes up heads, they measure the penguin's flipper length, and if it is tails they leave the flipper length blank.

What is the most likely type of missingness in this case?

( ) Missing Completely at Random
( ) Missing at Random
( ) Not Missing at Random
( ) Missing by Design

Below, you may optionally provide justification for your answer. If your answer above is correct, you will get full credit even if you do not provide justification. However, if your answer above is wrong, you may receive some credit if you provide justification and it is reasonable.

# BEGIN SOLN
**Answer: ** Option A

The answer is MCAR since the flipping of the coin is a random decider that will determine whether a penguin will have a missing measurment or not.

<average>87</average>
