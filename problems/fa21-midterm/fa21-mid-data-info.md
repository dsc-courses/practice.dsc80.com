**Coding Questions**

This exam has several coding questions. These questions will be manually graded, and your answers are not expected to be syntactically-perfect! Be careful not to spend too much time perfecting your code.

You may of course run any code you like during the exam, but doing so very often may cause you to run out of time. The exam is designed so that you do not need to run any code.

**Point Distribution**

Every question below is worth 1 point, **except** for:

- Question 11, the main coding question, worth 7 points,
- Questions 7 and 19, two smaller coding questions worth 2 points each.

Partial credit is not possible for 1 point questions unless otherwise stated, but it is available for the coding questions. Budget your time accordingly!

**The Data Set**

The table below shows data collected for 330 penguins in Antarctica. Each row represents one penguin.  Three species of penguins appear in the data set: "Adelie", "Gentoo", and "Chinstrap". This data set will be referred to throughout the exam as the DataFrame `df`.
