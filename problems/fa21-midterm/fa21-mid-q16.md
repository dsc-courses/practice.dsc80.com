Suppose some of the body masses are missing. You'd like to test if some of the body masses are missing at random (MAR) dependent on the species. You will determine this with a permutation test. Which one of the below is a valid test statistic for this test?

( ) the TVD (total variation distance)
( ) the K-S statistic (Kolmogorov-Smirnov)
( ) the absolute (unsigned) difference in means
( ) the signed difference in means

# BEGIN SOLN
**Answer: ** Option A

Another way to think of this question, is that we're looking at the distribution of species for missing body masses vs distribution of species for non-missing body masses. And since species is a qualitative variable, TVD would work well as a test statistic. 

<average>38</average>
