Diego wants to compare the two cummulative probability distributions
with the Kolmogorov--Smirnov statistic. At first, he plots the two
cummulative distributions (as shown in the figure below):

Fatima wants to explore the relationship between gamer's employment
status and sleep duration distribution. She wants to test the following
hypotheses.

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The distributions of `"Sleep Duration"` for
    gamers with full-time employment and gamers without any employment
    are drawn from the same population distribution, and any observed
    differences are due to random chance.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: The distributions of `"Sleep Duration"`
    for gamers with full-time employment and gamers without any
    employment are drawn from different population distributions.

The two sleep duration distributions are shown here.

Which test statistic should Fatima use?

( ) Signed difference between the average sleep duration of gamers with
full-time and without any employment

( ) The total variation distance

( ) Absolute difference between the average sleep duration of gamers
with full-time and without any employment

( ) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic between the two sleep duration
distributions

While keeping the same null hypothesis, Fatima wants to change the
alternative hypothesis to the following:

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: Unemployed Gamers has lower average
    sleep duration than gamers with full-time employment.

Which test statistic should Fatima use now?

( ) Signed difference between the average sleep duration of gamers with
full-time and without any employment

( ) The total variation distance

( ) Absolute difference between the average sleep duration of gamers
with full-time and without any employment

( ) Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic between the two sleep duration
distributions
