Yuxin would like to compare the distribution of `"Score"` for gaming
sessions with and without break. In the following histogram plot, we can
see the score distributions. Note that the vertical dash line on the
histogram indicates the mean values of the two distributions. The smooth
solid line shows the kernel density estimate of the two distributions.

Now, she'd like to test the following hypotheses:

-   **Null Hypothesis**: The distributions of `"score"` for gaming
    sessions with and without breaks are drawn from the same population
    distribution, and any observed differences are due to random chance.

-   **Alternative Hypothesis**: Gaming sessions with breaks have a
    higher average `"score"` than the gaming sessions without breaks.

What type of test is this?

( ) a standard hypothesis test

( ) a permutation test

Which test statistic should Yuxin pick? Select all that apply.

[ ] Signed difference between the average score with and without break

[ ] The total variation distance since we are comparing distributions
of two different categories

[ ] Absolute difference between the average score with and without
break

[ ] Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) statistic between the two score
distributions (i.e., with and without break)

In this specific scenario outlined in question 1, let A be the smallest
observed test statistic necessary to reject the null hypothesis at a 1%
significance level. Let B be the smallest observed test statistic
necessary to reject the null hypothesis at a 5% significance level.

What is the relationship between A and B?

( ) $A > B$

( ) $A < B$

In a few sentences, explain the logic behind relationship between A and
B.
