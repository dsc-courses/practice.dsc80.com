# BEGIN PROB

Suppose you wish to run a permutation test to determine whether the missingness in the
\col{urgency} column is Missing at Random because of an association with values in the
\col{category} column. Which test statistic should be used?

\byversion{
    \begin{choices}
        \choice The TVD between the distribution of categories in tasks where the urgency is missing,
        and the distribution of categories in tasks where the urgency is not missing.
        \choice The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic between the distribution of categories in tasks where the urgency is missing,
        and the distribution of categories in tasks where the urgency is not missing.
        \choice The TVD between the distribution of urgencies in tasks where the category is missing,
        and the distribution of urgencies in tasks where the category is not missing.
        \choice The Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic between the distribution of urgencies in tasks where the category is missing,
        and the distribution of urgencies in tasks where the category is not missing.
    \end{choices}
