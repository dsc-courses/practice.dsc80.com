# BEGIN PROB

Suppose you wish to perform a permutation test to check the following hypotheses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Null}: The urgencies of completed tasks are drawn from the same distribution as the urgencies of uncompleted tasks.
    \item \textbf{Alternative}: The distribution of urgencies for completed tasks is different from the distribution of urgencies for uncompleted tasks.
\end{itemize}

What is the \emph{best} test statistic for this test?

    \begin{choices}
        \choice the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic
        \correctchoice the Total Variation Distance
        \choice the \emph{signed} difference between the mean urgency of completed tasks and the mean urgency of uncompleted tasks
        \choice the \emph{absolute} difference between the mean urgency of completed tasks and the mean urgency of uncompleted tasks
    \end{choices}
