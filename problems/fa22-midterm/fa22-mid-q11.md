# BEGIN PROB

Suppose you wish to perform a permutation test to check the following hypotheses:

 - **Null**: The urgencies of completed tasks are drawn from the same distribution as the urgencies of uncompleted tasks.
 - **Alternative**: The distribution of urgencies for completed tasks is different from the distribution of urgencies for uncompleted tasks.

What is the *best* test statistic for this test?

( ) the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic
( ) the Total Variation Distance
( ) the *signed* difference between the mean urgency of completed tasks and the mean urgency of uncompleted tasks
( ) the *absolute* difference between the mean urgency of completed tasks and the mean urgency of uncompleted tasks

# BEGIN SOLN
**Answer: ** Option B

Since we're looking at the distribution of urgencies between two different groups, and urgencies is a categorical variable, it would make the most sense to use TVD here.

<average>90</average>

# END SOLN

# END PROB
