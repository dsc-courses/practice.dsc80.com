What *kind* of data is in the `'minutes'` column in the `tasks` DataFrame?

( ) Quantitative
( ) Ordinal
( ) Nominal

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer: ** Quantitative

The `'minutes'` column is quantitative because it is numeric and it makes sense to perform calculations with it. For instance, it would be valid to consider the average minutes spent per task.

<average>100</average>
