What *kind* of data is in the `'urgency'` column in the `tasks` dataframe?

( ) Quantitative
( ) Ordinal
( ) Nominal

# BEGIN SOLN

**Answer: ** Ordinal

The `'urgency'` column is ordinal because each task is "given a rating  of a task's importance on a scale from 1 to 3", implying that there is a natural within this column. While one could make the argument that this column is quantitative, it makes more sense to categorize each task based on its urgency.

<average>76</average>
