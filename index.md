This site contains practice problems taken from old DSC 80 exams. Each exam linked here lists the conditions under which the exam was given, including the allotted amount of time and the resources allowed. For the best preparation, work through all the questions on an exam in order under these same conditions, writing down your answers **on paper** as you go, then check all your answers at the end. It's especially important that you practice on paper, since your exams will also be on paper. Even though you will see some multiple choice bubbles, you intentionally cannot select them.

<div class="alert alert-danger" role="alert"><b>Note</b>: The exam that will be most representative of the Winter 2023 Final Exam is the Spring 2022 Final Exam. The other exams will still provide useful practice, though!</div>
